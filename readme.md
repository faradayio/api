## Overview

Faraday exposes a REST-style API for retrieving and manipulating data.

### Versions

* API version `v1` is currently in **alpha**

### Contributing

* **Want a new resource exposed in the API?** Submit a pull request documenting the change you'd like to see.

* **Have a question or other feedback?** Open an issue.

## Basics

All API requests share some common components.

### Environments

Two environments are offered for developer convenience:

* The **production** environment performs all requests against production data, returns complete responses, and incurs charges where applicable. Use of your **production API key** will perform API operations on the production environment.

* The **test** environment uses fake random data, will not make any changes, and does not incur charges. Use of your **test API key** will perform API operations on the test environment.

<!--
### Rate limiting

API package | Rate limit
------------|------------------
Free        | 100 requests/hour
Standard    | 1,000 requests/hour
Extended    | Unlimited

#### After you hit your limit

Faraday will return [status 429](http://httpstatus.es/429).

#### Checking rate limit status

All responses include a `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` header. To check your quota without performing a real request, use the `HEAD` action instad of `GET`, `POST`, etc.
-->

### URLs

API requests use the following base URL:

```
https://api.faraday.io/v1
```

HTTPS is required for all requests.

### Authentication

Request an API token from Customer Success.

Authentication to the API occurs via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username, leaving the password section blank.

```shell
$ curl https://api.faraday.io/v1/audiences \
  -u sk_test_E6V2sxvyYD5PX8a1tqqNE3eG:
```

### Headers

Required headers are in **bold**.

Header | Description | Example
-------|-------------|--------
**`Accept`** | Indicates desired response format. Currently only JSON is supported. | `Accept: application/json`
`Content-Type` | **Required for POST requests.** Indicates the request format. Currently only JSON is supported. | `Content-Type: application/json`
`X-Request-Id` | If this header is set with a UUID in the request, it will be returned as-is in the response. Potentially useful for handling parallelized API consumption. | `X-Request-Id: 3fe4594e-10f5-46e8-8ab3-28b812a3fc47`

### Parameters

The Faraday API accepts parameters in the query string (for GET-style requests) and as JSON in the request body (for POST-style requests).

<!--

### Accepting charges

Many requests will cause your account to be charged. In order to avoid confusion, Faraday requires that you indicate your acknowledgement of this using the `Faraday-Accept-Charges` header:

Value | Intent
------|-------
`false`     | **I do not accept charges for this request.** If the request would cause your account to be charged, Faraday will instead return [status 402](http://httpstatus.es/402).
`true`    | **I accept charges for this request**.

-->

### Special request value types

The request-level documentation below occasionally refers to a special type for a parameter.

#### Segment specification

A *segment* describes the group of all known Faraday households in a given *geography* that meet certain *criteria*. A *segment specification* serializes this description into a JSON object:

Top-level key | Description | Example
--------------|-------------|--------
`geography` | A [geography](#geography) or array of geographies within which the households must be located to be included in the segment. When the array form is used, households must belong to *at least one* element to be considered in-segment. | `[{ "type": "place", "id": 1234 }, { "type": "place", "id": 5678 }]`
`criteria` | An object whose key-value pairs are [attribute conditions](#attribute-condition) which households must meet to be included in the segment. A household must meet *all* criteria to be considered in-segment. | `[{ "household_income": [80000, 120000], "credit_rating": [700, "Infinity"]}]`

#### Geography

A *geography* is used to describe a geographical area. There are currently five types of geographic areas that Faraday supports: **named places**, **zip codes**, **radius around current customers**, **radius around points of interest**, and **drawn areas**. Indicate geography type with the `type` field and use additional fields described below to identify the area itself.

The most common geography type is a **named place**. Faraday maintains a [list of named places](https://github.com/faradayio/places).

The format for each of the supported geography types:

* **Named place**: `{ "type": "place", "id": "01234" }`. `id` must be a string to allow for leading zeroes.
* **Zip code**: `{ "type": "zipcode", "id": "05401" }`
* **Custom shape** `{ "type": "custom_shape", "shape": {...} }`. The provided `shape must be valid [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/).
* **Radius around customers** (must be combined with a non-radius geography type) `{ "type": "customer_proximity", "distance": 1000 }`. `distance` is radius in meters.
* **Radius around points of interest** (must be combined with a non-radius geography type) `{ "type": "poi_proximity", "distance": 1000, "points_of_interest": [123, 456]}`

Note that radiuses only work when combined with a named place, zip code, or custom shape.

#### Attribute condition

An *attribute condition* is generally one element of a JSON object listing several household criteria. Each such element must conform to the format appropriate for the [household attribute](#list-household-attributes) in question:

* **Continuously variabled attributes** are specified with a range: `"household_income": [80000, 120000]`. For unbounded ranges, use `"-Infinity"` (no minimum) and `"Infinity"` (no maximum). To specifically look for null values (no coverage), use `"NULL"`.

* **Boolean attributes**: `"gardener": false`. To specifically look for null values (no coverage), use `"NULL"`; if non-truthy, `"FALSE_OR_NULL"`.

* **Categorical attributes** are specified with an array of valid desired categories: `"house_style": ["Ranch", "Townhouse"]`. Households must belong to *one* of the listed categories to meet the condition. To specifically look for null values (no coverage), use `"NULL"`.

### Responses

All responses will arrive as JSON. Your requests should include the `Accept: application/json` header to acknowledge this.

## Requests

* [Record a customer](#record-a-customer)
* [Record a lead](#record-a-lead)
* [Record a prospect](#record-a-prospect)
* [Upload a file](#upload-a-file)
* [List household attributes](#list-household-attributes)
* [List products](#list-products)

### Record a customer

**Status:** Live

A *customer* is a household that has purchased your product or service, whether or not as a result of Faraday-facilitated outreach. Reporting your customers to Faraday improves predictions and allows you to visualize and target your customers with the platform.

#### Response

The response is a JSON array, each element of which is an object with the following structure:

Top-level key | Description | Example
--------------|-------------|--------
`name`        | The `snake_case` identifier for the attribute | `household_income`
`description` | A short human-readable description of the attribute | `Household income`
`type`        | Either `continuous` (numeric), `boolean`, or an array of valid categories (each a string) for categorical attributes | `continuous`

### List products
